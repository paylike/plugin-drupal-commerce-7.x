## Installation

Once you have installed Drupal Commerce on your Drupal setup, follow these simple steps:
  1. Signup at [paylike.io](https://paylike.io) (itâ€™s free)
   1. Create a live account
   1. Create an app key for your Drupal website
   1. Upload the ```paylike.zip``` trough the Drupal Admin
   1. Download and install the Paylike PHP Library version 1.0.4 or newer
          from https://github.com/paylike/php-api/releases. The recommended technique is
          to use the command:

          `drush ldl paylike`

          If you don't use `drush ldl paylike`, download and install the Paylike library in
          `sites/all/libraries/paylike` such that the path to `composer.json`
          is `sites/all/libraries/paylike/composer.json`. YOU MUST CLEAR THE CACHE AFTER
          CHANGING THE PAYLIKE PHP LIBRARY. The Libraries module caches its memory of
          libraries like the Paylike Library.
   1. Activate the plugin through the 'Modules' screen in Drupal.
   1.  Visit your Drupal Commerce Store Administration page, Configuration
       section, and enable the gateway under the Payment methods.
       (admin/commerce/config/payment-methods)
   1. Insert Paylike API keys, from https://app.paylike.io.
       Go to `admin/commerce/config/payment-methods/manage/commerce_payment_commerce_paylike/` and click edit on actions to get to the configuration screen
   1. Select the default credit transaction type. This module supports immediate
              or delayed capture modes. Immediate capture will be done when users confirm
              their orders. In delayed mode administrator should capture the money manually from
              orders administration page (admin/commerce/orders). Select an order under the payment section you will have the capture/void/refund options available based on the current state of the order
